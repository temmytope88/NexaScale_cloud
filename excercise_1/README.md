# Task

1. Create an AWS account, setup your root account MFA verification.
2. Create an IAM user called “ADMIN” with administrative privilege. Then go ahead to setup it’s MFA verification too.
3. Write an article on any platform of your choice on what you learnt.

## Article

The major things I learn during the course of creating the ADMIN users are:

1. The use of IAM identity center. It makes the creation of a user easier.
2. How to create a group and setting the required permissions (AdministrativeAccess) for the group
3. Adding the created user "ADMIN" to the group.
